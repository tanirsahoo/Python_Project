# What makes this Registration App useful?

This Registration App has a tinge of orange & white reminisces of the fire and is representative of our passion to offer to our users a app that will serve our users well and  will let them experience a smooth hassle-free UI-experience that will help them have a uninterrupted workflow because:

# Synopsis:
            "Creating a regristration app module for professional use,using Python:GUI."

The vision of this project is to create an app that enables all users to register for a certain company,whilst providing essential details/information for the registration process.

In today's modern era,the old pen and paper methods of registration have become suboptimal when compared with their electronic counterpart viz apps and webpages.Thus,catering to the usefulness and availability of resources,we have chosen tho generalise the basic module as much as we could for ease of convenience of our users.

One of the key featues of this product is that it can also generate a persistance list of all the registered candidates,which could be accessed by the designated managers and authorities at a later time.

The project can be broadly classified into two parts:<br />Front-End(UI/HI/UX), <br />Back-End(concerned with logical implementation of the useful features).

This app's creation involves the usage of python

# Modules/Libraries(in-built):

tkinter: tkinter is one of the more popular python libraries is used for this project, offering us a number of standard GUI building blocks.<br />

          messagebox
          simpledialog
          filedialog
          
csv: ,<br />

os: ,<br />

# Modules/Libraries(open-source):

numpy: .<br/>

# Advantages of using this app:

a. Gain deeper candidate knowledge,<br />
b. Make applicant comparison easier(job application specific),<br />
c. Flexibility of background checks as well as applications.<br />

# Future -Updates:

To conclude,this app is a prototype and serves as the base model for several already running registration apps.This app aims to provide the best user experience as well as the simplest registration mechanism and an easier time for the managers.
